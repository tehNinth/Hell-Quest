## Hell-Quest
A client for AQW originally made by isair.  
It has been abandoned for quite some time. However, since it's still mostly operational,
I've decided to take up the project by adding features and removing old, buggy crap.

## Notes on versions
### 0.9.1  
- Changed title to credit myself more (planning to add proper credits later)  
- Mostly removed that horrible "Checking for modifications hurr durr wait 3 seconds" thing  
- Starting the client now automatically goes to the AQW game instaed of a dead link  
- Removed the option to connect to Hell Quest servers (because dead-link)  
- Removed Clan Management (because dead link)  
- Added an extra option for sending chat packets to send Guild messages  
- Added function to hit Enter to send when typing a Shop ID and Hair ID instead of relying on the button  
- Removed "Load Enhancement" functionality to avoid getting kicked by mistake, replaced with informative message  
- Added Character Page viewer  
- Changed the skin because the old one had issues with compiling correctly  
- Fixed an issue where the client's width would be changed
- Updated base URL for game files
- Adjusted height for the buttons along the bottom
- Added function to hit Enter to send for Chat box
- Added an extra option for sending chat packets to send Party messages

More to come!

## Compiling
For compiling, I use Codegear Delphi&copy; 2009 with AlphaControls 2013 (8.40) and Shockwave Flash.

* Get AlphaControls here <http://www.alphaskins.com/>  
* Get Flash imported by going to Components > Import Component... > Import ActiveX Control >
Selecting "Shockwave Flash" > Select your desired pallette stuff (I went by the default) >
Install to New Package > Save it anywhere and give it whatever description you want >
And you're done! Flash is registered properly!
