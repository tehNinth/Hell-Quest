Hell-Quest
==========

A client for AQW originally made by isair, has been abandoned for quite some time.  
However, since it's still mostly operational, I've decided to take up the project by adding features and removing old, buggy crap.  

This Source should be compiled using Delphi 2009 with an Active X Shockwave module installed and AlphaControls 8.50.
